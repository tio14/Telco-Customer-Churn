Customers are the most important asset for a company. It is the main focus of the business. A company usually puts in a big effort to get customers in the initial phase of building the company. Only After they gain the customer's trust, their business can continue to live on. But the work continues beyond there. They have to keep their existing customers to continue using their service and it is a challenging task.

Customer churn is a customers stop using a service, either they don't need the service anymore or they change to another service provider. Acquiring a new customer is far more expensive than retaining the existing ones. Even an [article](https://mailchimp.com/resources/customer-churn/) says that *"Acquiring a new customer can cost a business 5x more than retaining an existing one"*. Therefore, customer churn is a critical factor for sustaining long-term profitability.
